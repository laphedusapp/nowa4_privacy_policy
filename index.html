We use this to create and manage your account, and we store this information securely using Supabase Authentication. Your unique user ID (Supabase Auth UID) is used to associate your data with your account.</p>
                    <p>- <strong>Prompt History:</strong> The text prompts you enter for image generation are saved to your account to provide you with a history of your creations. This data is stored in our Supabase database and is only accessible by you.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>Information We Collect Automatically:</strong></p>
                    <p>- <strong>Usage and Transaction Data:</strong> We track your token balance and transaction history to manage your use of the image generation service. This is stored in our Supabase database, linked to your user ID.</p>
                    <p>- <strong>Local Data:</strong> For a faster and smoother experience, we store some data on your device, including your token balance, history sync flags (in secure storage), and a cached version of your prompt history (history_cache.json).</p>
                    <p>- <strong>Diagnostics and Analytics (Optional):</strong> If you opt-in, we collect anonymous crash reports and usage analytics to help us identify and fix bugs, and to understand how our app is used. This data is aggregated and does not personally identify you.</p>
